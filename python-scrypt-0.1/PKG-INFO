Description: Python bindings to the 'scrypt' memory-hard KDF algorithm
        
        This offers a python interface to a C implementation of the scrypt
        key-derivation function (http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html/), using code
        from the 'scrypt' encryption utility on that page.
        
        This algorithm takes a password and derives a random key from it, using
        significant (but configurable) CPU and memory in the process. By design, an
        attacker must spend comparable resources to test each guess, increasing the
        costs of a brute-force attack. scrypt is specifically designed to yield no
        speedups to hardware-based attacks (like GPUs), unlike ordinary iterated
        hashing functions like PBKDF2.
